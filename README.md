# No Thousands Separators

Update 2.2 (or 2.21? idk will look this up later) added thousands separators (commas) to some of the displayed numbers in Geometry Dash. This mod remove them. Requested by someone.

Secret coins stats are not handled, will do in like 10000 years (or you can just uncomment them in the code).

pokok e mengdelet koma tina angka di geometry dash, y udah that's it sih

## TODO:
- fix text alignment (it's actually working but there're mysterious invisible CCFontSprite that only appears when setting labels with the string that have some characters removed from the og string. idk how to fix this atm)
- add feature to level stats
- add feature to leaderboard
- add feature to profile detail (that popup thingy that appears by clicking the i button near the username)
